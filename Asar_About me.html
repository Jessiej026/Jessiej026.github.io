				<h2>SO WHO AM I?</h2>
				<p>My name is Jessica Asare. I am a rising junior studying Cybersecuirty and Business 
					at Mount St. Marys University. I live in Maryland but am from Ghana.I spend my free time exploring the area, 
					finding cool spots with my friends and 
					marking them. 
				</p>
				<h3> Fun Facts...</h3>
				<p>
					I've got a love for all things living, from Elephants to medicinal herbs.
					My favorite color is pink and pastel colors. I'm a foodie at heart and enjoy 
					trying dishes from different parts of the world.
				
			     Some of my favorite things to do 
				 are watching the sunrise and sunset, taking pictures of 
					beautiful scenery, spending time alone, spending time with friends and family, and learning more about myself 
					and the world. I'm a firm believer in the power of positivity and mindfulness.Embracing my motto of taking things one day at a time, 
					I find peace and joy in each moment, knowing that everything unfolds as it's meant to.
