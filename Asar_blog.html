                            <h3>FIRST DAY OF COLLEGE</h3>
                            <p>Looking back on my freshman year,
                                 I'm struck by how much I've evolved since those early days.
                                 What began as a journey marked by uncertainty and excitement has transformed into a path of self-discovery and growth.
                                  As a freshman, every experience felt like a milestone, from navigating campus to forming new friendships. 
                                  Now, as an incoming junior, I cherish those memories and recognize the profound impact they've had on my personal and academic development.

                            <h3>ORIENTATION LEADER</h3>
                            <p>Last summer was the first summer I partcipated in the orientation leadeer program. 
                                Serving as a guide and mentor to incoming students was not just a responsibility but a privilege.
                                 Each interaction, whether it was helping someone find their way on campus or offering words of encouragement, 
                                 left a lasting impression on me. Being part of their journey as they embarked on this new chapter was incredibly rewarding.
                                  It taught me the importance of empathy, patience, and the power of community. As an orientation leader, 
                                I not only welcomed new faces but also forged connections that I'll carry with me long after the summer ended.</p>

                            <p>I had the honour of participating in the cybersecurity program at 
                     The Washington Center. My time was filled with learning about the different industries in cybersecurity.
                     I had an amazing time listeing to words of advise from industry proffesionals along with making new connections.
                    From visiting Amazon Web Services to workshops I learnt so much about myself. It was encouriging to hear
                    relatable words from leaders in the industry and being filed in a room with like-minded future leaders linke myself.
